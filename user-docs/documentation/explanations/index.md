# Introduction

In our opinion, a good technical framework empowers its users. It should not work as black box but instead treat its users as co-developers, able to participate in its elaboration.

This is why we want Swarmion users to clearly grasp the concepts behind it. Every decision made in Swarmion should be explained in this section.

In these pages, we will try to explain the choices we've made in Swarmion. If you find anything unclear or if you disagree with our explanations, feel free to [open an issue on Swarmion](https://github.com/swarmion/swarmion/issues)!
