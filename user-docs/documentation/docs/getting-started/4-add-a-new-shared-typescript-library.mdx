# Add a new shared TypeScript library

## Generate a new shared TypeScript library

Let's add a new `utils` shared TypeScript library to the project:

```bash
pnpm generate-library utils
```

:::info
The `generate-library` command is a shorthand for the following command defined in the root `package.json` file:

```bash
pnpm nx generate @swarmion/nx-plugin:library
```

To have more info on the `@swarmion/nx-plugin`, you can check its [documentation page](../how-to-guides/use-swarmion-generators).
:::

The `packages/utils` folder containing the `utils` shared TypeScript library has been added. The project dependency graph now looks like the following:

import ThemedImage from '@theme/ThemedImage';
import swarmionAppUtilsGraphLight from '../../static/screenshots/swarmion-app-utils-graph-light.png';
import swarmionAppUtilsGraphDark from '../../static/screenshots/swarmion-app-utils-graph-dark.png';

<div
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    display: 'flex',
    'justify-content': 'center',
    'margin-bottom': 'var(--ifm-leading)',
  }}
>
  <ThemedImage
    alt="Swarmion app with utils library"
    sources={{
      light: swarmionAppUtilsGraphLight,
      dark: swarmionAppUtilsGraphDark,
    }}
  />
</div>

Right now the library is not used by any library or services in the projet. Let's how to use it in a service.

## Make sure the code of the library is packaged

The source code of a library is written in TypeScript, but this is not the code that will be used by packages that will use it. In order to be used for all purposes, a library must be packaged in 3 formats:

- commonjs (for older Node.js processes)
- esm (for newer Node.js processes)
- .d.ts (for TypeScript and VS Code usage)

There are two commands that can be ran in the `packages/utils` folder to package the library:

```bash
# package the library in all formats once
pnpm package

# listen for changes and package the library in all formats automatically
pnpm watch
```

For the rest of the tutorial, we will consider that the `pnpm watch` command is running, hence that all changes to the library are automatically packaged.

## Use the library in a service

### Add the library to the service dependencies

To use the `utils` library in the `users` service, you need to first add it a normal npm dependency:

```bash
cd backend/users
pnpm add @my-project-name/utils
```

This will add the following line in the `dependencies` of the `backend/users/package.json` file:

```json
"dependencies": {
  ...
  "@my-project-name/utils": "workspace:^",
  ...
}
```

The project dependency graph now looks like the following:

import swarmionAppUtilsUsersGraphLight from '../../static/screenshots/swarmion-app-utils-users-graph-light.png';
import swarmionAppUtilsUsersGraphDark from '../../static/screenshots/swarmion-app-utils-users-graph-dark.png';

<div
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    display: 'flex',
    'justify-content': 'center',
    'margin-bottom': 'var(--ifm-leading)',
  }}
>
  <ThemedImage
    alt="Swarmion app with utils library used by users service"
    sources={{
      light: swarmionAppUtilsUsersGraphLight,
      dark: swarmionAppUtilsUsersGraphDark,
    }}
  />
</div>

### Reference the library as a TypeScript project

To make **Go to Definition** (the `Ctrl+Click` command) work accross inside `users` when clicking on code defined the `utils` library, you need to reference the `utils` library as a TypeScript project. To do so, add the following in the `backend/users/tsconfig.json` file:

```json
"references": [
  ...,
  {
    "path": "../../packages/utils/tsconfig.build.json"
  }
],
```

### Import code from the library

The `utils` library exports a single function `utils` defined in `packages/utils/src.utils.ts`. Let's use it in the `users` service:

```typescript
// backend/users/functions/health/handler.ts
import { utils } from '@my-project-name/utils';

export const main = async (): Promise<string> => {
  const utilsValue = utils();

  console.log({ utilsValue });

  return Promise.resolve('ok');
};
```

To check that import is working, we can either deploy the lambda and call the `GET /users/health` endpoint, or we can invoke the lambda locally:

```bash
pnpm serverless invoke local --function health

{ utilsValue: 'ok!' }
"ok"
```

## Wrap up

You now have a library that can be used to share code accross multiple services and event other libraries.

Next, we will see an important feature of a Swarmion app, contracts 🚀
