# VSCode support

Each package in the monorepo is defined as a workspace in the multi-root workspaces. It enables easier browsing and searching features, bringing the same navigation than in a standard codebase.

Using multi-root workspaces makes it possible to use the great vs-code extension, which makes it possible to run and debug tests directly inside VS Code.
